  `docker-compose build`
2. Run the container:
  `docker-compose up`

### Try It Out

## Static Site Setup

create a static website running on nginx.

1. Build the image:
  `docker build -f Dockerfile-static -t cve-web-static ..`
2. Run the container:
  `docker run -it -p 80:80 cve-web-static:latest`
