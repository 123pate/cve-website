            <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            This privacy policy describes:
            <ul>
              <li>The type of information that is collected</li>
              <li>How the information is used by MITRE</li>
              <li>What information may be provided to third parties</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Website Access Information</h2>
            <p>
              All accesses of {{siteName}} and cveform.mitre.org are logged. The following information is recorded for each visitor
              to the CVE website and cveform.mitre.org: IP address, date and time of access, the requested URL, the referring URL (if
              provided by the web browser), and the browser type (if provided by the web browser).
            </p>
            <p>
              The IP address and its associated domain name (if any) are used to determine broad demographic information. The IP address
              may be used to track how users navigate through the CVE website and cveform.mitre.org. User-entered keyword search strings
              are used to gauge user interest in specific types of vulnerability information. Each access of an individual CVE entry page
              is also used to gauge user interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web log information may also be provided to limited research groups within MITRE to support research related to the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p>
              The {{siteName}} and cveform.mitre.org websites do not presently use cookies. However, either may use cookies in the
              future to provide more detailed information regarding how users are navigating through the website, and to provide
              additional user functionality. MITRE will notify {{siteName}} and cveform.mitre.org users of this change as outlined
              in the "Notification of Privacy Changes" section.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Mailing List Subscription Information</h2>
            <p>
              MITRE performs due diligence to ensure that subscription information is kept confidential. In addition, all
              CVE-related mailing lists that are sponsored by MITRE are configured to prevent attackers from identifying the subscribers
              to such mailing lists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Optional information that subscribers may provide, such as company name, location, or job function, is used to determine
              broad demographic information regarding the types of users of these mailing lists. Subscribers are not required to provide
              this information.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Provision of Information to Third Parties</h2>
            <p>
              MITRE will not provide any information that identifies specific individuals, e.g., email addresses or IP addresses, to any
              other organization, except where required by law. MITRE may provide broad demographic information to other organizations.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Due Diligence for Intrusion Detection, Prevention, and Reporting</h2>
            <p>
              MITRE performs due diligence to preserve the integrity of the information on the CVE website and cveform.mitre.org. MITRE
              uses various logging and tracking mechanisms to support the detection, reporting, or recovery from attempted intrusions
              into {{siteName}} and cveform.mitre.org. MITRE reserves the right to use all available technologies without notice to
              protect its networks from unauthorized use, and to report attempted intrusions to the appropriate authorities.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Notification of Privacy Changes</h2>
            <p>
              If MITRE changes the information that is recorded on {{siteName}} and cveform.mitre.org, or changes the mechanisms by
              which this information is added, then MITRE will update this privacy statement and send an email notification to
              CVE-related mailing lists.
