                 CVE and NVD are separate programs. The <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">U.S. National Vulnerability
                 Database (NVD)</a> was launched by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of
                 Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> in 2005, while the
                 <router-link to='/About/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>CVE List</router-link> was launched by
                 <router-link to="/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#MITRE_role_in_cve">MITRE</router-link> as a community
                 effort in 1999.
               </p>
               <p>
                 NVD is a vulnerability database built upon and fully synchronized with the CVE List so
                 that any updates to CVE appear immediately in NVD.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The CVE List <span class="is-italic">feeds</span> NVD, which then builds upon the information
                 included in CVE Records to provide enhanced information for each CVE Record such as:
                 <ul>
                   <li>Severity scores and impact ratings</li>
                   <li>CPE information</li>
                   <li>Fix information</li>
                   <li>Searching by OS; by vendor name, product name, and/or version number; and by
                      vulnerability type, severity, related exploit range, and impact</li>
                   <li>Enhanced CVE content data feeds:</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>JSON Vulnerability Feed</li>
                     <li>RSS Vulnerability Feeds</li>
                     <li>Vulnerability Translation Feeds</li>
                     <li>Vulnerability Vendor Statements</li>

                While separate, both CVE and NVD are sponsored by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">

              The <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">CVSS</a> standard operated by the <a href="https://www.first.org/">Forum of Incident
              Response and Security Teams (FIRST)</a>, which is a separate program from CVE, can be used to score the severity of software
              vulnerabilities identified by CVE Records. The CVE Program itself does not provide severity scoring or prioritization ratings
              for software vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              CVSS Version 3.0 provides “a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability, and
              produce a numerical score reflecting its severity, as well as a textual representation of that
              score. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low,
              medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability
              management processes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              CVE Records are cited in the CVSS specification and documentation to identify individual vulnerabilities used as examples, but
              they are not required for using CVSS.

            <p>
              Severity rating scoring and prioritization for CVE Records is available through a
              <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss">CVSS calculator</a> provided by the
              <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the NVD website, which is operated by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and
              Technology (NIST)</a>, NVD’s CVSS calculator for CVE Records supports both the CVSS 2.0 and CVSS 3.0 standards and provides
              qualitative severity rankings for CVE Records using each version. In addition, NVD’s CVSS calculator also allows users to add
              two additional types of score data into their severity scoring: (1) temporal, for “metrics that change over time due to events
              external to the vulnerability,” and (2) environmental, for “scores customized to reflect the impact of the vulnerability on
              your organization.” For details and help, visit <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss">

            <p>
              Based in part on the CVE List, <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/">CWE™</a> is a community-developed list of common software and
              hardware security weaknesses that serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for
              weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. CWE is based in part on the CVE List, and numerous software CWEs
              are mapped to CVE Records. In addition, the CWE Program’s <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html">CWE Top 25 Most
              Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> analyzes CVE Records that map to a weakness and their CVSS scores assigned by NVD to rank
              CWEs based on a score that combines severity and frequency of the weakness.

              Developed by leveraging CWE and CVE, <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/">CAPEC™</a> is a comprehensive dictionary and
              classification taxonomy of known attacks that can be used by analysts, developers, testers, and educators to advance community
              understanding and enhance defenses. Some attack patterns target CVE Records. For example, CVE-2006-0201 is a citation
              in <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/93.html">CAPEC-93: Log Injection-Tampering-Forging</a>. Other attack
              patterns cite other CVE Records.

              <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">ATT&CK®</a> is a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and taxonomy for adversarial
              actions across their lifecycle. Some “Techniques” listed in ATT&CK, which define how an adversary achieves a tactical goal by
              performing an action, target specific CVE Records. For example, the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/">
              Privilege Escalation</a> technique includes the following citation: “<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007">APT28</a>
              has exploited CVE-2014-4076, CVE-2015-2387, CVE-2015-1701, CVE-2017-0263 to escalate privileges.” Other techniques cite other
              CVE Records.
