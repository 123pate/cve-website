              The CVE Program organization chart shows that the SPONSOR of the CVE Program is DHS CISA, with a direct line to SECRETARIAT (currently
              MITRE Corporation) to show that the Sponsor provides funding to the Secretariat to fulfill the mission of the program. From the
              SECRETARIAT, there is a direct line to the CVE BOARD. Beneath the Board, there are two lines, one of which connects to the CVE NUMBERING
               AUTHORITY (CNA) program hierarchy, and the other to the WORKING GROUPS. Directly below the Board in the CNA program hierarchy are two
               lines that each connect to a different TOP LEVEL-ROOT CNA (TLR-CNA), one of which is CISA ICS and the other MITRE. Beneath the CISA ICS
                TLR-CNA there is a single direct line to  a ROOT CNA, with this role fulfilled by CISA ICS. Beneath the CISA ICS Root CNA there are
                three direct lines, one to a CNA OF LAST RESORT (CNA-LR), with this role fulfilled by CISA ICS; the second to the multiple child CNAs
                 that are currently managed by the CISA ICS Root CNA; and a third to the AUTHORIZED DATA PUBLISHERS (ADPs) that are manage by CISA ICS
                  Root CNA. Beneath the MITRE TLR-CNA there are two direct lines, one to a Root CNA role fulfilled by MITRE and the second to a Root
                  CNA role fulfilled by JPCERT. Beneath the MITRE Root CNA there are three direct lines, one to a CNA-LR, with this role fulfilled by
                  MITRE; the second to the multiple child CNAs that are currently managed by the MITRE Root CNA; and a third to the ADPs that are
                  manage by MITRE Root CNA. And finally, beneath the JPCERT Root CNA there are three direct lines, one to a CNA-LR, with this role
                  fulfilled by MITRE; the second to the multiple child CNAs that are currently managed by the JPCERT Root CNA; and a third to the ADPs
                   that are manage by JPCERT Root CNA.
