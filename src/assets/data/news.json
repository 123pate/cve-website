The chairs and co-chairs of each WG, each of whom is an active member of the CVE community, chat about their WG’s overall mission, current work, and future plans. Discussion begins with the Transition (TWG), a temporary WG focused on managing the numerous modernization, automation, and process transitions currently underway in the CVE Program. Each of the five main WGs are then discussed in turn: Strategic Planning (SPWG), CNA Coordination (CNACWG), Quality (QWG), Automation (AWG), and Outreach and Communications (OCWG). How and why to participate, and the impact individuals can make on the program, are also included."
