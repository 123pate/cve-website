This includes a round of testing conducted by a third-party contractor for every major software release, and from there, they enter a triage process. As the vulnerabilities are being worked on, we look at the potential mitigations and risk involved using CVSS 3.1 to rank the severity of the vulnerability. As a CNA, we release a Security Advisory containing details of any identified vulnerabilities to our customers and list these publicly within a dedicated <a target='_blank' href='https://security.gallagher.com/en-NZ/Security-Advisories'>Security Advisory page</a> on our website. Furthermore, our <a target='_blank' href='https://security.gallagher.com/en-NZ/Responsible-Disclosure-Policy'>Responsible Disclosure Policy</a> provides a space for those who wish to report a vulnerability to Gallagher’s internal Security Advisory Committee."
