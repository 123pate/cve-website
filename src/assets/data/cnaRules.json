CVE makes it possible to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (cybersecurity tools, repositories, and services) with this common enumeration. The use of <a href='https://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#what_is_cve_entry'>CVE Records</a> ensures that two or more parties can confidently refer to a <a href='https://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#what_is_cve_id'>CVE Identifier (CVE ID)</a> when discussing or sharing information about a unique vulnerability. In this way, CVE is fundamental to the vulnerability management infrastructure.",

The CVE Program is overseen by the <a href='/ProgramOrganization/Board'>CVE Board</a> (hereinafter the Board). To address CVE’s scalability challenge, the Board determined that the CVE Program must be federated and that CVE IDs should be produced both more quickly and in a more decentralized manner."],

Participation in this program is voluntary, and the benefits of participation include the ability to publicly disclose a vulnerability with an already assigned CVE ID, the ability to control the disclosure of vulnerability information without pre-publishing, and notification of vulnerabilities in products within a CNA’s scope by researchers who request a CVE ID from them."],

Each Sub-CNA assigns CVE IDs for vulnerabilities in their own products or their domain of responsibility, hereinafter referred to as scope, and submits the vulnerability information to the CVE List when they make the vulnerability public. Sub-CNAs are administered and mentored by Root CNAs.",
				   "<strong>Root CNAs</strong> manage a group of Sub-CNAs within a given domain or community, and train and admit new Sub-CNAs, CNAs-LR, and Root CNAs within that domain or community.",
				   "At the top of the CNA hierarchy is the <strong>CVE Program Root CNA</strong>, which is a special type of Root CNA that oversees the entire CNA Program.",
				   "Since the Sub-CNAs administered by a Root CNA may not cover all of the vulnerabilities within that Root CNA’s scope, each Root CNA is responsible for assigning a <strong>CNA-LR</strong> to fill in the gaps. CNAs-LR also assign CVE IDs, but their scopes cover all vulnerabilities for their Root CNA that are not already covered by one of its Sub-CNAs.",
				   "Finally, while not a type of CNA, the <strong>Secretariat</strong> role supports many of the CNA functions (such as providing infrastructure and publishing the CVE List) and therefore is included in this document.",
				   "Each of the different types of CNAs, and the Secretariat, are roles that can be fulfilled by any organization that meets the requirements. These roles are not mutually exclusive, and a single organization can fulfill more than one of these roles at the same time. For example, the organization that operates a Root CNA may also choose to act as the CNA-LR for its scope.",

				   "Figure 1 shows that different Root CNAs have different areas of responsibility; each colored box depicts a distinct scope. A portion of the gray box in the center of the figure is shaded yellow to indicate that part of that scope has been delegated to a particular Root CNA and its Sub-CNAs.",
				   "In cases where requests or issues cannot be resolved by a given CNA, the issues are escalated to the next higher-level CNA. Examples of such issues would be a CNA being unresponsive beyond expected timeframes or a disagreement with a CNA over whether or not an issue is a vulnerability. Requests and issues at the Sub-CNA level can be elevated to Root CNAs, and requests and issues at the Root CNAs can be elevated to the Program Root CNA. The Program Root CNA has the right to require remediation or impose sanctions on CNAs (of any type) that do not comply with the CNA Rules; however, Root CNAs are the main enforcement mechanism. Root CNAs are responsible for enforcing the rules within their area of responsibility; the Program Root CNA is the enforcement mechanism of last resort. The Root CNAs have the same level of enforcement ability as the Program Root CNA, including remediation or sanctions, within their areas of responsibility, which enables the federation of the CVE Program by implementing a de-centralized governance approach.",
				   "Examples of remediation and sanctions include, but are not limited, to:<ul><li>The development of training, guidance, or implementation materials for use by the CNAs;</li><li>Retraining of CNA staff;</li><li>Additional process documentation and reporting from a CNA;</li><li>Reduction of the number of CVE IDs a CNA has available to assign at a time;</li><li>Rejection of CVE Entry submissions; and</li><li>Revocation of CNA status.</li></ul>",
				   "The same flow, from Sub-CNAs to Root CNAs to the Program Root CNA, is followed to alert the next higher CNA when CVEs are assigned, or when reporting other programmatic data (see Figure 2, below). If the Root CNA agrees, the Sub-CNA can go directly to the Secretariat while keeping the Root CNA in the loop. The Program Root CNA provides CVE IDs to Root CNAs, and Root CNAs provide blocks of IDs to Sub-CNAs. If the Root CNA agrees, the Sub-CNAs can go to the Secretariat for blocks of IDs as well.",
